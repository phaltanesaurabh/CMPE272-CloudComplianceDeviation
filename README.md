Compliance Manager for the cloud, a real time compliance measurement and compliance deviation detection System that can help organizations benchmark 

their security frameworks with regards to standard compliance like HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, NIST etc. This application provisions methods for continuous 

monitoring and alerting system to check compliance breaches with suitable recommendations for mitigating the same. The goal of the project is to 

enforce security measures and provide optimum visibility to different stakeholders about the security. The Compliance manager envisions Birds-­eye 

view over the possible causes for compliance breaches, abstract level metrics, over the top analysis for Business Owners about the compliance 

statuses and percentage deviation from the industry recommended standards for their Cloud infrastructures.

The Project Aggregates Logs over Cloud Environments to centralized Log Aggregation System and Runs Spark Ananlytics to analyze the Security Events 

and give the compliance devaition status for the Cloud Environment due to the detected Security Events . 

The Project can be extended as a plying mechanism between Log Aggregation System and Compliance Check Systems to Continuosly monitor the Compliance 

Status of environements and remediate/handle Security Events before the event affect the Compliance Status of the organizations.
