Compliance Manager for the cloud, a real time compliance measurement and compliance deviation detection System that can help organizations benchmark their security frameworks with regards to standard compliance like HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, NIST etc. This application provisions methods for continuous monitoring and alerting system to check compliance breaches with suitable recommendations for mitigating the same. The goal of the project is to enforce security measures and provide optimum visibility to different stakeholders about the security. The Compliance manager envisions Birds-­eye view over the possible causes for compliance breaches, abstract level metrics, over the top analysis for Business Owners about the compliance statuses and percentage deviation from the industry recommended standards for their Cloud infrastructures.

The Project Aggregates Logs over Cloud Environments to centralized Log Aggregation System and Runs Spark Ananlytics to analyze the Security Events and give the compliance devaition status for the Cloud Environment due to the detected Security Events monitoring and alerting system to check compliance breaches with suitable recommendations for mitigating the same.

The Project can be extended as a plying mechanism between Log Aggregation System and Compliance Check Systems to Continuosly monitor the Compliance 
Status of environements and remediate/handle Security Events before the event affect the Compliance Status of the organizations. <br />
